 * The renderer's scene-value unit convention.
 *
 * <p><b>A scene value is luminance in cd/m² (nits): {@code 1.0} = 1 cd/m².</b> This is a definition,
 * not a tuning knob — nothing here should ever be exposed as config. Light constants are authored
 * against it (sun ≈ 100,000 lux, full moon ≈ 0.25 lux, torch flame ≈ 15,000 cd/m²), which is what
 * makes them individually checkable against published photometric figures instead of only
 * meaningful relative to each other.
 *
 * <p>The renderer is RGB rather than spectral, so no radiometric-to-photometric conversion is
 * modelled: "luminance" means the AP1/D60 Y of the stored ACEScg triple, consistent with
 * {@code ACESCG_LUMA} in the metering shaders.
 *
 * <p>The EV100 metering scale, source-supplied light and emission values, exposure curve, and
 * shader-derived environment levels all use this convention.
