/**
 * Built-in refractive indices for the dielectric blocks vanilla ships.
 *
 * <p>Every dielectric is a volume: {@code world.rgen} refracts at the interface and pushes a
 * participating medium whose extinction attenuates the segment inside. IOR is therefore the whole
 * material description—it drives both the Snell bend and the Fresnel split, and determines the visible
 * distortion for each material.
 *
 * <p>Sprite-keyed rather than block-keyed because the material registry compiles per sprite, and
 * resolved once per sprite so it adds no variants to the profile x model x emission cross product. A
 * resource pack that renames textures falls back to the soda-lime default, and a
 * {@code materials/*.json} rule can set {@code transmission.ior} explicitly.
