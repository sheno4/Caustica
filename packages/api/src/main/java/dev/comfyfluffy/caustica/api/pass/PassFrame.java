/**
 * What every pass gets while recording one frame, whatever stage it records in.
 *
 * <p>The command buffer is mid-recording: the engine owns submission and the barriers into and out of each
 * stage, but barriers <em>between one pass's own dispatches</em> are that pass's job. The renderer's one
 * resource descriptor heap and one sampler descriptor heap are already bound before each pass records and
 * remain bound for the callback. A pass indexes those heaps directly and must not replace their bindings.
 *
 * <p>Subtypes expose stage-specific resources: {@link PostEffectFrame} provides the scene image and effect
 * chain, while {@link UiFrame} provides the UI layer and world-overlay resources.
 *
 * <p>The frame, command buffer, resource-retention capability, images, descriptor views, and subtype capabilities
 * are borrowed only for the current {@link Pass#record} invocation on that thread. Do not retain any of
 * them or call their methods after the callback returns. Commands recorded during the callback may continue
 * using the borrowed GPU resources; the renderer owns that asynchronous lifetime.
